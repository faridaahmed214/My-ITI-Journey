# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to problem-solving and training on **Data Structures and Algorithms**. It serves as a comprehensive collection of fundamental and advanced algorithmic implementations, showcasing various approaches to solving computational problems efficiently.

## Purpose
The DSA folder contains multiple C++ projects designed to:
- Master essential sorting and searching algorithms
- Implement fundamental data structures from scratch
- Demonstrate algorithmic problem-solving techniques
- Provide practical examples and hands-on experience with DSA concepts
- Build a strong foundation for competitive programming and technical interviews

## Contents
This folder includes implementations of:
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Stooge Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive), Sequential Search
- **Data Structures**: Doubly Linked Lists, Nodes, Queues, Stacks, Sorted Lists
- **Practical Applications**: Employee Management System utilizing multiple data structures

## Learning Path
Each project is self-contained and demonstrates specific concepts:
1. Start with basic algorithms (searches and simple sorts)
2. Progress to advanced sorting techniques
3. Implement complex data structures
4. Combine structures and algorithms in practical applications

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Code::Blocks
- **Compilation**: Standard C++ (GCC/MinGW)

## Projects Overview
- **Binary Search**: Fast search algorithm for sorted arrays
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple sorting with O(n²) complexity
- **Heap Sort**: Efficient sorting using heap data structure
- **Merge Sort**: Divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
- **Quick Sort**: Fast average-case sorting algorithm
- **Sequential Search**: Linear search for unsorted data
- **Stooge Sort**: Recursive sorting algorithm
- **EmployeeSystem**: Complex data structure application managing employee records

## How to Use
1. Navigate to any project folder
2. Open the `.cbp` file in Code::Blocks or compile with g++
3. Review the source code to understand the implementation
4. Compile and run to see the algorithm in action
